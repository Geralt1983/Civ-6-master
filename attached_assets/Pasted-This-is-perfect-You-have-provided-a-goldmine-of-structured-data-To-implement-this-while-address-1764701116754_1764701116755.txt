This is perfect. You have provided a goldmine of structured data.

To implement this while addressing your request about **Game Speed**:

**The Solution:**
We will store all these values in the database as **"Online Speed" (Baseline)** values. Our `advisor.ts` engine (which we built in the previous step) **already has the math** to normalize your current game turn back to this baseline.

  * *Example:* If you play on **Standard Speed** (2x slower) and are on **Turn 60**, the engine divides by 2, gets **30**, and checks the **"Turn 30"** benchmark from this file.

Here is the fully updated `strategyDb.ts` containing the massive dataset you extracted.

**Action:** Replace the entire contents of `client/src/lib/strategyDb.ts` with this code.

```typescript
// client/src/lib/strategyDb.ts

// --- SECTION 1: TURN BENCHMARKS (Baseline: ONLINE SPEED) ---
