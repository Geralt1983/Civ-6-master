To expand this to **every single civilization** (sieve), we need to massively grow the `CIV_STRATEGIES` database in `client/src/lib/strategyDb.ts`.

I have compiled the meta-strategies for **50+ leaders** (Base game, R\&F, Gathering Storm, and New Frontier) into the file below.

### **The Master Strategy Database**

**Action:** Replace the entire contents of `client/src/lib/strategyDb.ts` with this massive update.

```typescript
// client/src/lib/strategyDb.ts

// --- SECTION 1: TURN BENCHMARKS (Scaled by Game Speed in advisor.ts) ---

  },
